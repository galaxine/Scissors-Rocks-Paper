# Scissors-Rocks-Paper

It's a rocks paper scissors game, GUI comes later :D

## What I did:

I created a Scissors-Rock-Paper game in JS that can be played in the web browser.
I want to add some visuals later.
You can play against a computer

## How I did it?

I used loops to repeat every Round until someone had 3 points.
I also divided parts of the code into their own responsibility.
I tried my hand using JSDoc.

## What comes next?

I will learn a bit more about DOM and will add some
Theme behind it. I will have to write and sketch what exactly I want, but then translating it into code, sprites and music will be the hard part.
This will be done in a fork.
